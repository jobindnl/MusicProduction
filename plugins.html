                    Every song consists of these fundamental plugins. There are more plugins availble for you as you learn 
                    to be more familiar with the software, but these essential plugins will give you a solid head start

                    <div id="Delay" class="cover"></div>

                    <p>
                        Delay is used to create an echo of sorts. It plays back the first couple of milliseconds or seconds back to the user on repeat. This can be adjusted to your liking. It gives the listener as if they're hearing the instruments and singers inside of a bigger space.

                    <p>
                        EQ is primarily used to filter out certain bands of frequencies. Every sound has a low, medium, and high frequencies present that can be mainipulated. In general, lower frequency instruments like Bass are EQ'd in a way that its lower frequencies are enhanced, while cutting off most of its higher frequency

                    <div id="De-Esser" class="cover"></div>
                    <!-- <img src="img/De-Esser.jpg" alt=""> -->
                    <p>
                        De-Essers are used to reduce the harsh S's and T's a singer usually makes. Words beginning in those sounds have a tendency to cut through the mix and make an unpleasant sound to the listener. Its often better to roll back on these sounds

                    <p>
                        Reverb is used to give depth to a sound. Its effect gives the sample a bigger atmosphere, and its supposed to mimic
                        as if the instrument or vocal is being playing in a room of varying sizes. The size of the room can vary from a small
                        room to the size of a theatre

                    <h3>COMPRESSOR</h3>
                    <div id="Compressor" class="cover"></div>
                    <!-- <img src="img/EQ.jpg" alt=""> -->
                    <p>
                        Compressor's primary function is essentially to make the louder parts softer, and then raising the softer parts higher
                        in volume. This gives the song a more consistent sound throughout. Vocals have a very high dynamic range. An artist can sing parts that are low in volume, and then increase their loudness as the song progresses into a climax. In the context 
                        of a full song, the singers softer sounding vocals will be drowned out. To prevent this, the compressor brings up the 
                        volume on the softer side, and puts a ceiling of sorts on the louder parts

                    <h3>AUTO-TUNE</h3>
                    <div id="Auto-Tune" class="cover"></div>
                    <!-- <img src="img/EQ.jpg" alt=""> -->
                    <p>
                        Auto-Tune corrects the singers voice to a preselected key. Usually in production, everysinger utilizes some sort of pitch
                        correcting software. No singer is perfectly able to sing in key during a live performance. This plugin should be used 
                        minimally. Most artists have made it a style to overly use this effect and it has become their unique style

                        Delay is used to create an echo of sorts. It plays back the first couple of milliseconds or seconds back to the user on repeat. This can be adjusted to your liking. It gives the listener as if they're hearing the instruments and singers inside of a bigger space.

                        EQ is primarily used to filter out certain bands of frequencies. Every sound has a low, medium, and high frequencies present that can be mainipulated. In general, lower frequency instruments like Bass are EQ'd in a way that its lower frequencies are enhanced, while cutting off most of its higher frequency

                        De-Essers are used to reduce the harsh S's and T's a singer usually makes. Words beginning in those sounds have a tendency to cut through the mix and make an unpleasant sound to the listener. Its often better to roll back on these sounds
